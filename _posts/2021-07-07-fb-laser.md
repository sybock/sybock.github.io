# Facebook LASER

Last year, Facebook released code for [LASER, or Language-Agnostic SEntence Representations](https://github.com/facebookresearch/laser). As it states on their github, LASER is "a library to calculate and use multilingual sentence embeddings." I've read their papers, including the one where they explain the algorithm behind LASER and also the one where they use the data mined from LASER to train their M2M-100 language model. 

To summarize very briefly, LASER is an encoder model trained on 93 languages that is theoretically able to derive quality sentence embeddings for all of those languages. You can use it for multilingual document classification, multilingual mining, multilingual similarity comparisons and basically for performing various multilingual tasks. Also, the authors tweaked the algorithm used to compare sentence emeddings so that the cosine similarity threshold for similar sentences could be dynamically adjusted according to your dataset. 

It all sounds very good. Maybe too good...
